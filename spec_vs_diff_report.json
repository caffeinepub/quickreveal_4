  "summary": "The diff implements the majority of the 10 REQs for the NEXUS premium dark UI overhaul. Most requirements are well-covered, but several specific acceptance criteria details are missing or only partially implemented based on the available diff evidence.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "requirement": "REQ-2: Notification bell should show unread count (number) as a badge, not just a dot. The GlobalHeader only renders an 8px dot without displaying the actual count value.",
      "reason": "The GlobalHeader.tsx renders a small dot span (8px circle) for the notification badge but does not display the notificationCount number visually inside or next to the badge.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/GlobalHeader.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "requirement": "REQ-7: Messages tab and Profil tab should navigate to their own dedicated screens. The diff wires 'messages' to 'explorer' and 'profile' to the reservations screen.",
      "reason": "BottomNav.tsx shows messages tab screen is 'explorer' and profile tab screen is reservationsScreen — neither has a dedicated screen, violating the 'wire each tab to its corresponding screen' requirement.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/BottomNav.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "requirement": "REQ-9: Skeleton loading states use a golden shimmer animation on #1A1A1A backgrounds — actual skeleton placeholder components should be rendered during data fetching states.",
      "reason": "The CSS for skeleton shimmer is defined in index.css, but no actual skeleton placeholder components are visible in the diff being rendered during loading states in Explorer, ProviderDetail, or other screens.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/index.css",
        "frontend/src/components/Explorer.tsx"

    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Tapping the search input opens a dropdown with Swiss Romande city options, and a golden distance slider opens on tapping the pill.",
      "reason": "Explorer.tsx is truncated in the diff; the dropdown and distance slider interaction implementations cannot be confirmed from the visible portion.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/Explorer.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "Tapping the sticky bottom CTA button initiates the booking flow for the selected service.",
      "reason": "ProviderDetail.tsx is truncated and the booking flow wiring from the sticky CTA cannot be confirmed from the visible portion of the diff.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/ProviderDetail.tsx"
      ]

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "The GlobalHeader includes a clickable NEXUS logo that navigates to the 'explorer' screen on click.",
      "reason": "The build request only specifies the header should display the NEXUS logo visually; no click/navigation behavior was requested for the header logo.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/GlobalHeader.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "The BottomNav Reservations tab navigates to different screens depending on appRole (nexusOS for professionals, clientDashboard for clients).",
      "reason": "The build request specifies the Reservations tab should navigate to its corresponding screen but does not specify role-based conditional navigation logic for the bottom nav.",
