Key implementations include: ProLogin with hardcoded authentication (REQ-63), NexusOS with RADAR, WALLET, PORTFOLIO, and AGENDA tabs (REQ-64, REQ-65, REQ-66, REQ-70), Builder multi-step form (REQ-67), Subscription screen (REQ-68), AppContext updates for state management (REQ-76), App.tsx router updates (REQ-77), clickable NEXUS logo navigation (REQ-72), geolocation filter implementation (REQ-75), and BookingLocation studio validation (REQ-74). However, several requirements show incomplete or missing implementations in the visible diff.",
