  "summary": "The diff implements most of the 8 requirements but has several gaps. REQ-1 through REQ-8 are largely addressed, but key sub-requirements are missing or incomplete: GlobalHeader still uses lucide-react Bell and User icons; Subscription.tsx and SubscriptionScreen.tsx advantage lists use green CheckIcon instead of SVG thin-dash bullets; the 'Voir mon profil public' button and pro-profile-at-position-1 logic are absent; Explorer card border uses 0.05 opacity instead of specified 0.06. Two hallucinated features appear in BookingFlow.tsx.",

      "requirement": "GlobalHeader bell and user icons must be replaced with inline SVG icons (stroke 1.5px, currentColor); lucide-react icons must not be used.",
