- Restore Version 8 color palette: background #0a0a0a, accent #E8D5B0 sand, removing all gold/copper colors
- Ensure Explorer displays 6 hardcoded providers with category/mode/city filters and geolocation
- Restore NEXUS OS with 4 tabs: RADAR, WALLET, PORTFOLIO, AGENDA
- Preserve complete booking flow (location, date with 4-day calendar, contact form)
- Maintain Builder 4-step form (profile, logistics, services, availability)
- Add fluid micro-interactions: button hover glow, scale transforms, 300ms transitions
- Implement elegant page transitions with fade-in and upward translation
- Add staggered reveal animations for list items with 100ms delay increments
- Enhance form inputs with focus glow, smooth transitions, error shake animations
- Add smooth card hover effects with lift, scale, and border glow
- Implement loading states with spinners and skeleton screens using sand accent
- Add success feedback animations with elastic checkmarks and bounce toasts
- Enhance navigation to be friction-free with consistent back buttons and scroll position
- Polish image displays with fade-in, shimmer placeholders, proper aspect ratios
- Refine typography hierarchy with Inter 900 uppercase and Playfair Display italic
- Remove LandingPage component and all Version 10 premium features completely
