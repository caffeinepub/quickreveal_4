  "summary": "The diff implements all three requirements: ProApp.tsx is created as a self-contained component with useState navigation, the C object with t4:'#2E2E3E' is defined, and RoleSelectionV2.tsx is updated to render <ProApp /> when 'Professionnel' is selected. However, the truncated ProApp.tsx makes it impossible to fully verify all AC items (e.g., IconCamera using C.t4, all discrete elements referencing C.t4, Subscription Success animation completeness). The ScreenRouter.tsx modification adds a ProApp import and uses it for several case routes — this was not requested and touches an existing file, though it does not break functionality.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "IconCamera SVG uses C.t4 as its fill/stroke color; all visually discrete elements (inactive icons, dividers, placeholder text) reference C.t4",
      "reason": "The ProApp.tsx file is truncated before the IconCamera SVG definition and the full icon/UI rendering code is cut off, so it cannot be confirmed that C.t4 is used for IconCamera fill/stroke and all discrete UI elements. The C object definition is present with t4:'#2E2E3E', but the actual usage cannot be verified from the truncated diff.",

      "reason": "The build request explicitly states 'Do not modify or rebuild the existing client navigation flow in App.tsx or ScreenRouter.tsx' as a hard constraint. ScreenRouter.tsx was modified to add a ProApp import and use it in several switch cases, which was not requested and violates the constraint.",
